Here's the complete flow of your application:
User Registration/Login:
User registers with email and password
User logs in to access the platform
Browse Hotels:
User browses the list of hotels near tourist places
Hotels display information like price, amenities, etc.
Booking Process:
User selects a hotel and enters check-in/check-out dates
System calculates the total price
User confirms and creates a booking
At this point, the booking is created with "pending" status
Web Check-in:
This is a pre-arrival process for the user (like airline check-ins)
User accesses their booking before arrival
User provides Aadhaar numbers (Indian ID) for all family members
This helps the hotel prepare for guests and speeds up the physical check-in
The booking status changes to "checked-in"
Hotel Stay & Checkout:
User arrives at the hotel (physical check-in is faster due to web check-in)
After their stay, they checkout
Booking status could change to "completed"




things to improve
The web check-in functionality makes the hotel booking experience smoother by:
Collecting guest information in advance (names, ID numbers)
Reducing time spent at the front desk during physical check-in
Allowing hotels to prepare for guests in advance
Providing security by verifying guest identities through Aadhaar
